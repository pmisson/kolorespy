Fabio Falchi:

Hi Thomas,
this is a second post, the first did not arrive in the ML.

conversion from magnitudes/arcsecond² to nL are in Garstang 1986:
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986PASP...98..364G
Several conversions are given in Cinzano's book `inquinamento luminoso e protezione del cielo notturno' in this chapter:
http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/cinzano/libro/node59.html#SECTION00410000000000000000
especially in these paragraphs:
http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/cinzano/libro/node62.html#SECTION00413000000000000000
http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/cinzano/libro/node63.html#SECTION00414000000000000000
Equation 67 gives the magnitudes/arcsecond² to cd/m² conversion.
The book is also available in pdf here:
http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/cinzano/libro/index.html
The html version allows for a translation via googlechrome.

Best,
Fabio

Dear Thomas and colleagues,

There is a difference of 1.8% between the  unihedron formula and Cinzano 1997. Probably is a rounding error

I understand that for popularization of science is more comfortable to use candles that magnitudes. But, we want to extend our studies to other bands of observation,
including non astronomical. One example is the response of living organisms and others.

For this I would suggest using astronomical standards. They are easy to calibrate in the world, because our standards are Vega and the Sun.

Soon we will want to take measures with high precision, so it is important to use a comfortable photometric system.

For me, the most comfortable system is to use AB magnitudes. Its definition is simple Janskys. AB = -2.5 log10 f [Jy]  +8.6               Magnituds V_vega = V (AB) + 0.044 (+ / - 0.004)

In the band V 1Jy ~ 0.0345 +-0.0005 cd.(Only in V band). In astronomy is more useful to use mJy.

The Jy advantage is that it is defined for all bands, is a well-defined standard astronomical, is a multiple of the SI units, is lineal so easy to convert to Candels or any other unit (natural sky or any).

I send you  my excel sheet personal use for converting units. 

Here you can check more information about this and some natural Night Sky Brightness for five astronomical bands.

I hope you find it useful.
